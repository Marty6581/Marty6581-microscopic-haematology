          <p><strong>Case Study 21</strong></p>
          <p>
            The patient in this case study was a male diagnosed
            with infantile nephrotic cystinosis at the age of
            eleven months. Nephrotic cystinosis is a rare
            autosomal recessive disorder resulting in the
            accumulation of cystine crystals primarily in the
            kidney as well as other organs, including the bone
            marrow. These crystals are almost never seen in the
            peripheral blood. Cystinosis presents between six
            and twelve months of age. The clinical
            characteristics include failure to thrive,
            progressive renal failure, loss of muscle function,
            photophobia and fair hair. Diagnosis is made by
            measuring the level of cystine in peripheral blood
            white cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the age of eleven years, the patient’s condition
            had progressed to a stage which involved renal
            failure requiring peritoneal dialysis and frequent
            blood transfusions. At the age of thirteen, he
            received a renal transplant, the kidney being
            donated by a family member. He was then started on a
            regimen of immunosuppressive therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the age of twenty the patient was experiencing
            neurological abnormalities. He had difficulty in
            walking and swallowing, loss of memory and
            progressive loss of speech as well as diminished
            intellectual function. He continued to receive
            immunosuppressive therapy for his renal transplant.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the age of twenty-six he presented to the
            Casualty Department. He had cervical and mediastinal
            lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. A full blood count
            was performed with the following results:<br />
            Hb 115 g/L, WBC 5.4 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet
            count 197 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. The peripheral blood
            film revealed the presence of circulating blast
            cells. A bone marrow biopsy was performed. The bone
            marrow was hypercellular with 70% blasts. The blasts
            had a high N/C ratio; the nuclei were variable from
            round to irregular and folded in shape. They
            contained one to four distinct nucleoli.
            Immunophenotyping was performed with the following
            results:</p>
            <p>
            CD45<sup>+</sup>, HLA-DR<sup>–</sup>,
            CD19<sup>+</sup>, cytoCD79a<sup>+</sup>,
            cytoCD3<sup>+</sup>, CD2<sup>+</sup>,
            CD5<sup>+</sup>, CD7<sup>+</sup>, CD38<sup>+</sup>
            and CD117<sup>+</sup>.<br />
            CD4<sup>–</sup>, CD8<sup>–</sup>. 
          </p>
            <p>A diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukaemia was made.<br />
            CD2, 5 and 7 are the most commonly expressed markers
            in T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia. CD3 is often present
            in the cytoplasm but not on the surface. CD4 and CD8
            may be expressed or may be negative.</p>
            <p>
            Co-expression of CD79a and CD117 has been described
            on primitive T cell lineages however the expression
            of CD19, normally a B cell marker, is unusual.
          </p>
          <p>
            A cytogenetic analysis on the available cells
            revealed a 46, XY karyotype. Subsequent fluorescence
            in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies showed no
            evidence of BCR-ABL 1 gene rearrangements.

          <p>
            Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorders (PTLD)
            are a well-known complication of immunosuppressive
            treatment after solid organ transplantation. Any
            lymphoma/leukaemia that occurs in the
            post-transplant population is considered to be a
            type of PTLD. The median time from transplant to
            diagnosis is fifteen years. The majority of post
            transplant lymphoma/leukaemias are B cell in origin
            and are associated with EBV infection. T-cell
            variants are very rare. The patient in this study
            was EBV positive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The risk factors of PTLD are intensity of
            immunosuppression, type of organ transplanted,
            Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seronegativity and the
            duration of the immunosuppression. EBV
            seronegativity pre-transplant is a powerful
            predisposing factor for the development of PTLD.
            Studies show that EBV seronegative patients
            experience a 10-76 fold greater incidence of PTLD
            when compared to seropositive counterparts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The patient in this study died suddenly, two months
            post chemotherapy induction.

          <p><strong>Case Study 22</strong></p>
          <p>
            A three-year-old female child presented at the
            casualty department. She had been unwell with
            tonsillitis for the past week. A full blood count
            revealed the following results:<br />
            Hb 67 g/L, WBC 24.2 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelets
            452 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood film was leucoerythroblastic with a
            reticulocytosis and a moderate number of
            spherocytes. There was an absolute neutrophilia of
            14.0 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. A preliminary diagnosis of
            autoimmune haemolysis was made. A direct
            antiglobulin test (DAT) was performed with a
            positive result. The LDH was raised at 666 IU/L
            demonstrating acute haemolysis. Urinalysis revealed
            dark brown urine with a small number of red cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            As this was an acute presentation (the child was
            well two weeks previously) the possibility of
            paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH) was
            considered. A Donath-Landsteiner test was performed
            and the result was positive.
          </p>
          <p>
            PCH is a disease characterised by the sudden
            presence of haemoglobin in the urine after exposure
            to cold temperatures. It occurs mostly in young
            children under the age of five years. There is a
            male to female ratio of 2:1 to 5:1.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1904 Julius Donath and Karl Landsteiner described
            an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia characterised by
            the presence of a biphasic antibody that attaches to
            red cells in the cold inducing haemolysis when the
            red cells are subsequently warmed. The Donath-
            Landsteiner (D-L) antibody is a polyclonal IgG
            binding to various red cell antigens such as I, i, p
            and P on the red cell surface. The P antigen is its
            primary target. This polyclonal IgG anti-P
            autoantibody binds to red blood cell surface
            antigens in the cold. When the blood returns to the
            warmer central circulation, the red cells are lysed
            with complement, causing intravascular haemolysis.
            The attachment of C3d on the red cells results in a
            positive DAT. The resultant blood picture is that of
            a normochromic normocytic anaemia with spherocytes,
            reticulocytes, especially in the recovery phase,
            auto agglutination and nucleated red cells.
            Monocytes and granulocytes sometimes show
            erythrophagocytosis.

            The Donath-Landsteiner (D-L) antibody test is
            performed as follows:<br />
            The method involves preparing three tubes: 1) the
            patient’s serum, 2) a mixture of patient’s serum and
            normal serum and 3) normal serum. To each tube is
            added P-positive red cells at 4℃. After 30 minutes
            the tubes are then heated to 37℃ and observed
            visually for haemolysis, indicative of a positive
            result.
          </p>
          <p>
            PCH is associated with upper respiratory and
            gastrointestinal symptoms. It may occur following
            measles, mumps, influenza, varicella zoster virus,
            cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus,
            parvovirus B19, Coxsackie A9,
            <em>Haemophilus influenzae,</em>
            <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> and
            <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>. It also may occur
            post vaccination for measles.
          </p>
          <p>
            PCH is a self-limiting disease. If promptly
            diagnosed and appropriately treated with supportive
            care, most patients recover within days to a few
            weeks. Supportive treatment may include pre-warmed
            packed red blood cells as well as steroids although
            steroids have not been shown to shorten the course
            of the disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            The patient in this case study was transfused warm
            packed red blood cells. She remains well.

          <p><strong>Case Study 23</strong></p>
          <p>
            A 53-year-old male was referred to the Haematology
            clinic with severe back pain together with a
            normochromic, normocytic anaemia for investigation.
            A full blood count was performed with the following
            results:<br />
            Hb 108 x g/L, WBC 4.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, platelet
            count 227 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and ESR of 125 mm/hr.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood film confirmed a normochromic, normocytic
            anaemia with a marked increase in rouleaux
            formation. The white cells and platelets were normal
            in number and morphology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Serum proteins were performed. A paraprotein IgGk of
            91g/L was identified by immunofixation in the beta
            globulin region.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bence Jones protein, 3.49 g/24hr, was found in the
            urine.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bone marrow aspiration was performed. There was a
            heavy infiltrate of plasma cells displacing much of
            the normal haematopoietic tissue of the marrow. The
            plasma cells were large with eccentrically placed

          <p>
            Plasma cell myeloma is a neoplasm occurring more
            commonly in males. The median age at presentation is
            50 years. The initial presentation is associated
            with bone pain, back, neck and pelvic pain.
            Radiographic findings reveal lytic lesions and
            osteoporosis. Pathological fractures can occur in up
            70% of patients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plasma cell myeloma is diagnosed from the bone
            marrow. It is invariably associated with a
            paraprotein or M-protein in the serum and/or the
            urine. The protein in the urine is referred to as
            Bence Jones protein.
          </p>
          <p>
            Symptomatic plasma cell myeloma is associated with
            CRAB: hypercalcaemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia
            and bone lesions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The peripheral blood shows an increase in rouleaux
            formation. Plasma cells are found in approximately
            15% of cases and only in small numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bone marrow shows an increase in plasma cells,
            more than 3% and sometimes up to 90%. Mature plasma
            cells are oval to round in shape with round
            eccentric nuclei. The cytoplasm is basophilic with a
            perinuclear hof. Crystals as well as globules of
            immunoglobulin are sometimes seen in the cytoplasm.
            Plasma cells appear in clusters or sheets within the
            marrow with preservation of normal haematopoiesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the number of plasma cells in the peripheral
            blood exceeds 2 x 10<sup>9</sup>L the neoplasm is
            referred to as plasma cell leukaemia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plasma cell myeloma is usually incurable. It has a
            median survival of 3-4 years. Transplantation may be
            attempted to increase and prolong quality of life.
          </p>
          <p>The patient in this case study remains well.</p>

          <p><strong>Case Study 24</strong></p>
          <p>
            An 8 year old child with Pfeiffer syndrome presented
            at the Paediatric Casualty Department. She had a two
            week history of severe pallor and progressive
            lethargy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pfeiffer syndrome is a genetic disorder
            characterised by craniosynostosis, visual impairment
            and ocular proptosis. It is thought to be associated
            with deficiencies associated with fibroblast growth
            factor receptors on chromosome 8 and 10.
          </p>
          <p>
            This young child was of short statue. She had
            dysmorphic features and was blind. She demonstrated
            reduced exercise tolerance, unable to keep up with
            her siblings. She had a history of complex
            neurosurgical and plastic surgery. She had
            difficulty in eating solids hence her dietary intake
            was pureed solids; meats, fish and dairy products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her parents had become Jehovah Witnesses in 2006.
          </p>
          <p>
            A full blood count was performed with the following
            results:<br />
            Hb 23 g/L, WBC 6.8 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and Platelet
            count 259 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.<br />
            The RBC was 1.97 x1012/L, Hct 0.100, MCV 51.8 fL and
            RDW-CV 23.1%.<br />
            The Reticulocyte count was 1.5% and absolute count
            29.4 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.<br />
            The blood film revealed a marked microcytic,
            hypochromic anaemia with elliptocytes and pencil
            cells consistent with a severe iron deficiency
            anaemia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iron studies were performed with the following
            results:<br />
            Iron 1.2 µmol/L, Transferrin 3.8 g/L, Iron
            saturation 1.3% and Ferritin 1 µg/L.<br />
            Parvovirus B19 was negative and the Hb EPG was
            normal.

          <p>
            The Medical Dilemma was now clearly an acute life
            threatening event. The child had cardiac signs and
            was at risk of cardiac failure or arrest. She was in
            need of intensive care. There was also a need to
            acknowledge the religious beliefs of the family. At
            this point a hospital administrator was called. The
            parents reluctantly consented for a blood
            transfusion. Meanwhile the child’s father contacted
            support from the Jehovah Witness community to attend
            the hospital. Consent to transfuse was withdrawn.
          </p>
          <p>
            The possibility of an iron transfusion and
            administration of erythropoietin was discussed.
            However the Consultant Haematologist caring for the
            child was adamant that she required an urgent blood
            transfusion. At this point in time the hospital
            Chief Executive Officer was contacted as was a
            social worker, Department of Community Services and
            the Child Protection Consultant. The Consultant
            Haematologist was requested to attend the Supreme
            Court under section 174 of the Children and Young
            Persons Act 1998. However, provided the Consultant
            Haematologist was prepared to sign an affidavit that
            the child required a transfusion a visit to the
            court could be waived. An affidavit was signed and
            the child was transfused.
          </p>
          <p>The post transfusion Hb was 125 g/l.</p>
          <p>
            The Department of Community Services was not
            required in this case and the child was discharged.

          <p><strong>Case Study 25</strong></p>
          <p>
            Late one evening, a full blood count was received on
            a full term neonate who had just been delivered by
            caesarean section. The clinical notes read ‘pallor’.
            The results from the analyser were as follows:<br />
            Hb 64 g/L, MCV 118.9 fL, reticulocyte count 13.4 %
            (254 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L), WBC 16.2 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelets 278 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Hb result of 64 g/L is abnormally low for a
            newborn neonate; the normal range being 121 – 191
            g/L in the above laboratory. A repeat specimen was
            requested. The Hb was now 60 g/L, confirming the
            initial result. Whilst the blood film was being
            stained a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was
            performed with a negative result. Both the infant
            and mother were group O positive and an antibody
            screen performed on the mother was negative. The
            total bilirubin was 140 umol/L, NR (0-150 umol/L).
          </p>
          <p>
            The infant was transfused with two units of packed
            cells.

          <p>
            The blood film revealed a nucleated red cell count
            (NRBC) of 674 NRBCs / 100 WBCs. The normal range
            being 1-25 NRBCs / 100 WBCs. The blood film image (x
            400) demonstrates the markedly increased number of
            red cell precursors while the blood film images (x
            1000) demonstrate marked dyserythropoiesis. Note the
            nuclear budding and cytoplasmic bridging, classical
            features of dysplasia.
          </p>
          <p>
            A differential diagnosis on this infant would
            include a fetomaternal bleed or less probably
            Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anaemia (CDA). A
            Kleihauer test was performed on the mother to check
            for a fetomaternal bleed. The Kleihauer test was
            positive; the presence of 3.84 % fetal cells
            translated to a transplacental haemorrhage of 95.84
            mls. Hence the initial diagnosis of a fetomaternal
            bleed was confirmed.

          <p>
            Some degree of fetomaternal transfusion occurs in
            approximately 50% of all pregnancies. The most
            frequently observed causes of occult haemorrhage
            prior to birth include abdominal or multiple trauma,
            amniocentesis in the third trimester, post external
            cephalic version, placental tumours and spontaneous
            haemorrhages. Haemoglobin values as low as 30 to 60
            g/L have been recorded in infants who were born
            alive and survived.
          </p>
          <p>
            The clinical manifestations of a fetomaternal
            haemorrhage depend on the rapidity with which it has
            occurred. If the haemorrhage has been prolonged,
            giving the fetus the opportunity to compensate for
            the anaemia, the infant may manifest only pallor at
            birth. However, if the haemorrhage is acute, the
            infant may be pale and sluggish, have gasping
            respirations and manifest signs of circulatory
            shock.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood film may also be informative. In an acute
            haemorrhage, the red cells are normochromic
            normocytic whereas in a more prolonged fetomaternal
            haemorrhage the red cells may be microcytic and
            hypochromic. Note that the NRBCs in this case
            exhibited ragged cytoplasm, a feature seen in iron
            deficiency. The MCV on this neonate was slightly
            raised at 118.9 fL, NR (101-117 fL). This was
            secondary to the significantly raised reticulocyte
            count of 13.4 % NR (4-7 %). In anaemia secondary to
            a fetomaternal haemorrhage the DAT test is negative
            and the infants are not jaundiced. The presence of a
            very high NRBC count is an index of fetal stress.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diagnosis of a fetomaternal haemorrhage can be
            made with certainty by demonstrating the presence of
            fetal cells in the maternal circulation. This is
            done by performing the Kleihauer-Betke test. The
            Kleihauer image above demonstrates the presence of
            acid-resistant fetal red cells on a background of
            acid sensitive adult red cells that appear as ghost
            cells. Note that the Kleihauer-Betke method has been
            replaced by a flow cytometry test for the estimation
            of HbF in many laboratories.
          </p>
          <p>
            The infant in this update maintained a stable
            haemoglobin post transfusion hence a potential
            diagnosis of CDA was not pursued. Mother and infant
            went home several days after confinement.

          <p>
            Abetalipoproteinaemia is a rare autosomal recessive
            disorder characterised by the presence of
            acanthocytic red cells in the peripheral blood. The
            primary defect is due to a mutation and lack of
            activity in the microsomal triglyceride transfer
            protein needed to bind lipids to the
            ?-apolipoprotein in plasma. Intestinal absorption of
            lipids is defective. The plasma levels of
            cholesterol and triglyceride are extremely low and
            ?-apolipoprotein undetectable. There is an increase
            in sphingomyelin in the outer half of the red cell
            membrane bilayer increasing the surface layer of the
            cell. This ?-apolipoprotein defect leads to the
            production of acanthocytic red cells, about 50-90%
            of the red cells being acanthocytes. The
            sphingomyelin accumulates with cell ageing thus the
            nucleated precursor red cells and reticulocytes are
            not affected while the older red cells are affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of fat malabsorption and the absence of
            low density lipoproteins, which transport vitamin E,
            the red cells of patients with abetalipoproteinaemia
            are markedly deficient in vitamin E. The level of
            vitamin A is also reduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Abetalipoproteinaemia usually presents in early
            childhood with diarrhoea and failure to thrive and
            is characterised clinically by fat malabsorption,
            spinocerebellar degeneration, pigmented retinopathy
            and acanthocytosis. The initial neurologic
            manifestations are loss of deep-tendon reflexes,
            ataxia and development of a spastic gait. They also
            develop retinitis pigmentosa which ultimately
            progresses to near-blindness. The neurological
            abnormalities present between five and ten years of
            age and continue until death in the second or third
            decade. Despite the marked acanthocytosis and
            vitamin E deficiency seen in these patients, anaemia
            and haemolysis are mild. The haemoglobin levels are
            invariably normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Treatment consists of a low-fat, high caloric,
            vitamin-enriched diet accompanied by large
            supplemental doses of vitamin E. It is imperative
            that treatment be initiated as soon as possible to
            delay the onset of the neurological symptoms. New
            therapies for this debilitating disease are needed.

            A 29 year old female presented to the Casualty
            Department feeling generally unwell. At 28 weeks
            gestation she was hypertensive with proteinuria. She
            had with her an Advanced Health Care Directive
            stating that no transfusions of whole blood, red
            cells, white cells, platelets or plasma be

            presumptive diagnosis of pre-eclampsia.

            She was severely thrombocytopenic with disseminated
            intravascular coagulation (DIC). The blood film and
            differential count showed the presence of 15% blast
            cells and 55% abnormal promyelocytes. A diagnosis of
            acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) was made. A bone
            marrow aspiration was performed. The differential
            count on the bone marrow showed the presence of 86%
            abnormal promyelocytes. Cytogenetics showed a
            t(15;17). FISH confirmed a PML/RARA fusion.
            Immunophenotyping was as follows:<br />
            CD45+, HLA-DR-, CD11b-, CD13+, CD15-, CD33+, CD34-,
            CD64+, CD117+, CD2+, CD22+ and MPO+
          </p>
          <p>
            The above patient was transferred to a ward under
            joint obstetric and haematology care. A number of
            issues were before this medical team. They were
            presented with a patient with APL, DIC and severe
            thrombocytopenia. She was 28 weeks pregnant with
            pre-eclampsia and from deeply-held conviction,
            refused blood product support. Therefore performing
            a caesarean section was not safe. She was given
            steroids for fetal lung maturity as well as all
            trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the drug of choice for
            the treatment of APL.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the next few days the white cell count steadily
            rose as did the urea, creatinine and liver function
            tests. Her hypertension was difficult to control.
            Labour was induced with failure to progress. On the
            ninth day after admission, a stillborn fetus was
            delivered vaginally. There was minimal blood loss.
            It is thought that the stillborn infant was directly
            related to the acute renal failure in the mother.

            10<sup>9</sup>/L, the Hb was 48 g/L and platelet
            count 17 x 109/L. Her renal function had
            deteriorated. The blood urea was 24.0 mmol/L and
            creatinine 282 mmol/L. The liver function became
            acutely deranged – GGT 59 U/L, AST 80 U/L and ALT
            369 U/L.
          </p>
          <p>
            She was admitted to intensive care where she was
            intubated. Her neurological function deteriorated.
            She was now hemiplegic. By day twelve there was
            further deterioration in her neurological function.
            On day thirteen treatment was withdrawn.

            There are two types of APL. The hypergranular or
            typical type characterised by abnormal promyelocytes
            whose cytoplasm is densely packed with granules and
            Auer rods and the hypogranular or microgranular type
            whose cytoplasm shows a paucity or absence of
            granules and occasional Auer rods. The granules in
            these abnormal promyelocytes contain procoagulant
            mediators which, when released into the circulation,
            cause a life-threatening coagulopathy or DIC. The
            dilemma with the above patient was her severe
            thrombocytopenia, DIC and her refusal to accept
            blood products. Current therapy of ATRA combined
            with chemotherapy results in 70 to 80% patient
            survival and disease-free outcome after five years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial visit by this patient to the hospital
            was to surrender an Advanced Health Care Directive
            stating that she would not accept a transfusion of
            red cells, white cells or platelets. As an adult she
            is able to make this decision. In the case of a
            child, a court order would ensure that the child be
            treated appropriately.

            A clinical chemistry profile was also performed:<br />
            The LDH was raised at 3436 U/L.

          <p>
            The test results, together with the clinical
            symptoms of the patient indicated that she had a
            severe haemolytic anaemia suggestive of Paroxysmal
            Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH). A Ham’s test was
            performed. This is an acidified serum test which
            detects a population of red cells with sensitivity
            to complement-mediated lysis. The Ham’s test was
            positive. A diagnosis of PNH was confirmed on the
            above patient.
          </p>
          <p>
            PNH is a rare, acquired, clonal disorder of the bone
            marrow characterised by a total or partial lack of
            proteins normally attached to the haemopoietic cell
            membrane by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)
            anchor. This defect is due to a somatic mutation of
            the phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIG-A) gene
            on the X chromosome which encodes for a protein
            needed for the synthesis of GPI anchor. Without GPI
            anchor, an essential group of membrane proteins are
            either reduced or absent in all haemopoietic cell
            lines. These proteins include complement-regulating
            surface proteins namely decay-accelerating factor
            (DAF) or CD55, membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis
            protein (MIRL) or CD59 and the homologous
            restriction factor (HRF) or CD8 binding protein. All
            of these proteins interact with complement,
            particularly C3b and C4b, protecting cells against
            lysis. In their absence, haemopoietic cells are
            exposed to complement leading to uncontrolled
            amplification of the complement cascade and
            destruction of the red cell membrane leading to
            intravascular haemolysis.

            PNH cells are classified as PNH Type I, Type II and
            Type III cells. PNH Type I cells have normal levels
            of CD59; PNH Type II cells have reduced levels while
            PNH Type III cells completely lack CD59 expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patients with PNH present with symptoms of
            haemolysis, namely, low haemoglobin, raised
            reticulocyte count and raised lactate dehydrogenase
            (LDH). The DAT is negative as there are no
            antibodies involved. They also present with isolated
            or multiple cytopenias and/or a history of
            thrombosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that in 1999 the Ham’s test was used to make
            the diagnosis of PNH. Today flow cytometry must be
            used to make that diagnosis. The presence and size
            of both red blood cell and granulocyte clones as
            defined by reduced or absent GPI-linked proteins,
            must be determined. The Australian Flow Cytometry
            Group has issued guidelines for the most appropriate
            flow testing (AFCG Guidelines at www.afcg.org.au).
            The guidelines recommend that CD59 expression should
            be determined on red blood cells and that for
            granulocytes and monocytes the first step is a
            lineage gate (eg CD33/SS) followed by expression of
            CD24/FLAER (granulocytes) and CD14/FLAER
            (monocytes).

            Until recently, the treatment for PNH was
            supportive. Patients were managed with iron and
            folate supplementation. They were also transfused
            when appropriate. Transfused red cells do not lack
            GPI anchor thus are not vulnerable to complement
            lysis. About 50% of patients responded to
            corticosteroids. Allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow
            transplantation was and still is the only cure for
            PNH.

            In March 2007 the use of eculizumab (Soliris) was
            approved by the FDA. Eculizumab is a monoclonal
            antibody that targets and prevents cleavage of the
            terminal complement protein C5. In so doing it
            inhibits other complement components thus preventing
            haemolysis. Eculizumab has given patients with PNH a
            significant improvement in quality of life as well
            as a marked reduction in the frequency of thrombotic
            episodes. Many patients are no longer transfusion
            dependent. Long term treatment with eculizumab is
            well tolerated however it comes with significant
            cost consideration.

            The above patient was commenced on eculizumab in
            2009. It is now September 2010 and she is 39 years
            old. She has had a remarkable improvement in her
            quality of life whilst on eculizumab, so much so
            that she delivered a healthy baby girl on the 23rd
            of September. At last a Haematology Update with a
            happy ending!<br />

            A bone marrow aspirate was performed. The marrow was

            As coarse basophilic stippling in the red cells is a
            feature of lead poisoning, a lead level was
            performed. The lead was found to be 5.0 umol/L with
            a normal range of 0-0.5 umol/L. The level of mercury
            was also examined and found to be &lt;1 nmol/L with
            a normal range of ≤50 nmol/L.

          <p>
            After questioning the patient in this case study it
            became evident that the patient had been taking a
            medication supplied to her by her Indian doctor. The
            medicine was in a powder form. A sample of this
            medication was sent for analysis which showed that
            the powder contained 12 % lead.<br />
            Patients with lead poisoning clinically present with
            abdominal colic and constipation, peripheral
            neuropathy and anaemia. The anaemia is invariably a
            hypochromic microcytic anaemia as the ingestion of
            lead interferes with haem synthesis. It does so by
            inhibiting several enzymes directly involved with
            haem synthesis. Pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase is one
            such enzyme.
          </p>
          <p>
            In its absence, pyrimidine nucleotides accumulate in
            the red cells, preventing iron from being
            incorporated into haem at a normal rate. This leads
            to a shortened red cell life span resulting in a
            mild haemolytic anaemia. The characteristic feature
            on the blood film in lead poisoning is coarse
            basophilic stippling in the red cells. The
            hypochromic microcytosis is not necessarily
            associated with iron deficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The patient in this case study was treated with
            Meso-2-3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) commonly
            known as succimer, a compound approved by the FDA in
            the 1960’s for the chelation or removal of heavy
            metals, particularly lead and mercury. She was
            initially given a three week course of succimer, 400
            mg in the morning and 600 mg in the evening. Her
            haemoglobin began to rise while the level of lead
            began to fall. Two months later a similar course of
            succimer was administered. By the end of the second
            course the lead level was 0.8 umol/L, still
            significantly raised. The haemoglobin had returned
            to normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Public Health Act (1991) states that a lead
            level of ≥0.72 umol/L must be notified and that
            repeat testing should occur after three months to
            assess the effectiveness of treatment.

            The blood film showed an absolute neutrophilia with
            marked toxic granulation; moderate numbers of
            microspherocytes and thrombocytopenia. These
            features are classically found in Clostridium
            perfringens infection. This was a case of severe
            septicaemia and haemolysis secondary to necrotising
            fasciitis. See figure 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term necrotising fasciitis describes a condition
            of rapidly spreading infection, usually located in
            fascial planes of connective tissue resulting in
            tissue necrosis. Fascial planes are bands of
            connective tissue that surround muscles, nerves and
            blood vessels. The speed with which necrotising
            fasciitis spreads is directly proportional to the
            thickness of the subcutaneous layer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many types of bacteria can cause necrotising
            fasciitis ( e.g., Group A streptococcus (<em
              >Streptococcus pyogenes</em
            >)<em
              >, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium
              perfringens,</em
            >
            <em>Bacteroides fragilis, Aeromonas hydrophila</em
            >). The disease is classified as either Type I
            (polymicrobial) caused by a number of different
            organisms or Type II (monomicrobial) caused by a
            single organism. The causative organism may be
            aerobic or anaerobic.<br />
            The frequency of necrotizing fasciitis has been on
            the rise due to an increase in immunocompromised
            patients with diabetes mellitus, cancer, alcoholism,
            vascular insufficiencies, organ transplants, HIV
            infection and also occurs in patients with
            neutropenia<br />
            The mean age of a patient with necrotizing fasciitis
            is 38-44 years. The disease rarely occurs in
            children. Paediatric cases have been reported from
            resource-poor nations where poor hygiene is
            prevalent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The patient in this case study was diagnosed with
            Clostridium perfringens induced necrotising
            fasciitis. <em>Clostridium perfringens</em> is a
            saprophytic organism inhabiting the bowel and
            genital tract. It has no pathological significance
            in the absence of clinical infection.
            <em>Clostridium perfringens</em> produces at least
            12 antigenic protein toxins, the most common of
            which is the alpha toxin. These toxins react with
            lipoprotein complexes on cell surfaces, liberating
            potent haemolytic substances known as lysolecithins
            which result in cell lysis, hence the presence of
            microspherocytes on the blood film. This process
            leads to a severe haemolytic anaemia. Acute renal
            and hepatic failure develops leading to death in as
            short a period as 12 hours if not treated
            immediately.

            The basis of treatment is surgical debridement of
            necrotic tissue and antibiotic therapy. In severe
            infections, hyperbaric oxygen is an important
            adjunct in the treatment of necrotising fasciitis.
            Massive doses of benzyl penicillin are administered
            intravenously. Should the patient be allergic to
            penicillin, metronidazole is effective in high
            doses.

            The patient in this case study died within 24 hours
            of having been admitted into the ICU ward.
