            <p><strong>Reference ranges for neonates and children</strong></p>
    
    <p>The importance of establishing a Reference Range for a particular population of subjects cannot be denied.</p>
    
    <p>The availability of blood specimens from 'healthy' children led to the decision to use this group of subjects to establish Reference Ranges for neonates and children.</p>
    
    <p>The particular population of children chosen was admitted to the urological ward for assessment of abnormal renal anatomy. These children were clinically well at the time of admission, had a normal urea and creatinine and a mid-stream specimen of urine devoid of cells, casts and organisms. Venous blood specimens were obtained during anaesthesia so as to avoid the stress of venepuncture affecting the blood count parameters.</p>

    <p>Cord blood was also collected from 'post delivery' mothers. These mothers acted as potential cord blood donors for the Australian Cord Blood Bank.</p>

    <p>A total of 927 subjects were used for this study. The Reference Ranges were calculated using the Percentile from each respective age group.</p>
