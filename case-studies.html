            The blood film of a patient with either hereditary stomatocytosis or
            Southeast Asian ovalocytosis will show stomatocytes as a common
            feature. However, there are important differences in the red cell

          <p>
            <strong>Hereditary stomatocytosis</strong>, often referred to as
            hereditary hydrocytosis, is a very rare autosomal dominant disorder,
            characterized by a defect in the Na<sup>+</sup> / K<sup>+</sup>
            exchange pump. There is an imbalance between the amount of Na<sup
              >+</sup
            >
            entering the red cell and the amount of K<sup>+</sup> exiting the
            cell. The red cell swells as it gains cations and water,
            transforming from a discocyte to a stomatocyte. These swollen cells
            are osmotically fragile. They become rigid, requiring extremely
            large amounts of energy to protect them against lysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The red cells of hereditary stomatocytosis lack stomatin (protein
            7.2b), an integral red cell membrane protein. The exact function of
            stomatin is unknown, but it is clearly important in regulating
            membrane sodium permeability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The laboratory findings in hereditary stomatocytosis include a
            macrocytic anaemia. The blood film shows stomatocytes and round
            macrocytes. The mean cell volume (MCV) is characteristically
            elevated in the range of 110-150 fL, and there is a correspondingly
            low mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in the range
            of 240-300 g/L. An elevated red cell Na<sup>+</sup> concentration
            and a reduced K<sup>+</sup> concentration, as well as an increased
            total monovalent cation content, are noted. These abnormal red cells
            are sequestrated on passing through the spleen, giving rise to
            extravascular haemolysis. The haemolytic anaemia is severe with a
            reticulocytosis of >10%. Splenectomy has proven to be the most
            beneficial treatment in reducing the degree of haemolysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Southeast Asian ovalocytosis</strong> is also an autosomal
            dominant disorder. It is very prevalent, occurring in up to 30% of
            aboriginal people from New Guinea, Malaysia, and Melanesia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The red cells of Southeast Asian ovalocytosis have a characteristic
            appearance on the blood film. They are often described as
            stomatocytic elliptocytes. Instead of being discocytes, they have a
            slit-like area of central pallor. A small proportion of these
            stomatocytes have two transverse slits, giving the appearance of
            double stomatocytes. The red cell membrane of these stomatocytes is
            very rigid. This abnormality results from increased ankyrin binding
            and decreased protein 3 mobility, leading to the production of rigid
            red cells. This rigidity is a protective mechanism against all
            strains of malaria. There is no abnormality in the red cell
            Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> exchange pump.
          </p>
          <p>
            The laboratory features of Southeast Asian ovalocytosis are
            unremarkable. The stomatocytes have a normal lifespan; hence, there
            is no anaemia. The MCV and MCHC are both characteristically within
            the normal range. In fact, nowadays, with the use of cell analyzers
            to auto-validate results without examining blood films in the
            presence of normal blood cell parameters, laboratories diagnose
            fewer cases of this asymptomatic condition.

              suggestive of a microangiopathic process. The blood film prepared

          <p>
            The HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low
            platelet count) is a multisystem disorder occurring in severe
            preeclampsia-eclampsia and is characterized by a microangiopathic
            haemolytic anaemia, hepatic dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. In
            many instances, this progresses to disseminated intravascular
            coagulation (DIC).
          </p>
          <p>
            The HELLP syndrome affects an estimated 4% to 12% of patients with
            severe preeclampsia. Its presence is recognized by the onset of
            symptoms and signs of hepatic involvement such as epigastric pain,
            nausea, and malaise, and on examination, right upper-quadrant
            tenderness. Because the HELLP syndrome is insidious in its onset,
            the early, milder form may be missed unless appropriate laboratory
            assessments—namely, FBC, LFTs, urea and creatinine, LDH, and DIC
            screen—are performed. Thus, the HELLP syndrome is often advanced
            before an accurate diagnosis is made.
          </p>
          <p>
            The HELLP syndrome affects primiparous and multiparous women in the
            third trimester of pregnancy. Delivery of the fetus is the
            appropriate initial treatment. The syndrome remains active after
            delivery and appears to reach maximal intensity during the 24-48
            hour post-delivery period when thrombocytopenia, ALT, AST, and LDH
            all reach their peak. The pathogenesis is not clear. As a result of
            fetomaternal cell traffic, fetal products induce the release of
            agonists in the mother, causing vascular endothelial damage and
            platelet activation. This induces DIC, leading to fibrin deposition
            and obstruction to blood flow. Interference with flow in the liver
            leads to the high liver enzyme levels observed in the HELLP
            syndrome. Red cells are damaged as they pass through fibrin-coated
            vessels, resulting in haemolysis. Thrombocytopenia is due to both
            platelet consumption and destruction. There is a correlation between
            the platelet count and the severity of the HELLP syndrome. Platelet
            counts below 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L are associated with greater
            maternal morbidity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood picture in the HELLP syndrome is characterised by the
            presence of schistocytes together with thrombocytopenia. The
            summation at the end of the blood film report should always read
            'blood film consistent with a microangiopathic process'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plasmapheresis improves the HELLP parameters in non-responsive cases
            in the postpartum period. It removes a large variety of biologically
            active substances.

            Hairy cell leukaemia is an indolent malignant lymphoproliferative
            disease of B-cell origin. It occurs more often in men than in women
            (ratio 4:1). The classical form presents with pancytopenia,
            including neutropenia, and a mean white cell count of less than 4 x
            10/L. In 15%-20% of cases, there is a variant or leukaemic form with
            a mean white cell count of 88 x 10/L. The variant form is not
            neutropenic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hairy cells on the peripheral blood film in the classical form
            vary in size from 10-20 µm in diameter. The cell cytoplasm stains a
            pale blue-grey colour with many fine hair-like projections around
            the entire circumference of the cell. This is in contrast to the
            projections found on the cells of splenic marginal zone lymphoma
            which are thin and short and unevenly distributed, often
            concentrated towards one pole of the cell. In classical hairy cell
            leukaemia, the nucleus is often eccentric and is round to oval in
            shape. The hairy cells in the variant form are smaller with a
            diameter of 10-15 µm. The nuclei are generally placed centrally
            rather than eccentrically. In both forms, there may be few
            recognisable hairy cells in the peripheral blood and diagnosis
            relies on a bone marrow study. The marrow trephine shows a patchy or
            diffuse interstitial infiltrate characterized by a halo of
            pale-staining cytoplasm surrounding a sea of round to oval hairy
            cell nuclei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flow cytometry performed on hairy cell leukaemia shows expression of
            pan-B-cell antigens CD19, CD20 and CD22 but are negative for CD5 and
            CD23 (both being positive in B-CLL). Almost all cases of classical
            hairy cell leukaemia also express CD103, CD11c and CD25. In the
            variant form of hairy cell leukaemia, the cells are negative for
            CD25 (a pre B antigen) and positive/negative for CD103.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cytochemistry can be used to demonstrate the hairy cells on a blood
            film. In 95% of cases of classical hairy cell leukaemia, the cells
            show strong tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity
            whereas in the variant form, only 60% show TRAP activity and it is
            only weak. Thus TRAP activity studies are not really useful to
            confirm a diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are no specific cytogenetic changes in hairy cell leukaemia -
            add(14)(q32) occurs in 20% of cases, del(6)(q23) occurs in 10% of
            cases and del(14)(q22;q32) occurs in 10% of cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patients with the variant form of hairy cell leukaemia have a median
            survival of 5 years. Those with the classical form have a longer
            survival. Some patients with mild disease do not require treatment
            and have a prolonged survival. Complications in hairy cell leukaemia
            include infection due to neutropenia and immune dysfunction, anaemia
            due to bone marrow infiltration and bleeding due to
            thrombocytopenia.

            A 1 day old neonate presents with extreme jaundice at birth. A full
            blood count and chemistry profile are performed with the following
            results:

          <p>

            Total bilirubin 403 µmol/L and conjugated bilirubin 283 µmol/L.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood film shows extreme poikilocytosis with micropoikilocytes,
            microspherocytes, triangular fragments, budding red cells and
            polychromasia. It is noted from the blood film, that the platelet
            count is falsely elevated and the MCV is very low for age. (The MCV
            range for a 1day old full term neonate is 101 – 117 fL). The extreme
            poikilocytosis is the major contributing factor to the very low MCV.
            A diagnosis of hereditary pyropoikilocytosis is made on the blood

          <p>
            Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis is an autosomal recessive disorder
            characterised by severe haemolytic anaemia with thermal instability
            of the red cells. It forms part of a group of haemolytic anaemias
            due to red cell membrane abnormalities. This group also includes
            hereditary elliptocytosis, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis and
            hereditary spherocytosis. Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis is found
            predominantly in Africans and African Americans but has also been
            seen in Caucasians and Arabs. The disease presents in the neonate
            with anaemia and jaundice and is diagnosed from the blood film that
            shows bizarre poikilocytes, micropoikilocytes, microspherocytes,
            triangular fragments and budding red cells. These red cell changes
            are caused by mechanical instability of the red cell skeleton due to
            defective binding of the spectrin chains. Erythrocyte spectrin
            maintains the cellular shape and provides structural support for the
            lipid bilayer of the red cell membrane. Disruption of the spectrin
            complex leads to disorders characterised by abnormally shaped red
            cells. Hereditary elliptocytosis is due to a gene mutation resulting
            in a qualitative spectrin abnormality. Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis
            co-inherits this qualitative spectrin abnormality as well as a
            second mutation that causes a quantitative spectrin deficiency. Thus
            hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis are
            closely related disorders. Often one parent or a close relative of
            the child with hereditary pyropoikilocytosis will have hereditary
            elliptocytosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thermal sensitivity and osmotic fragility tests may be performed to
            aid in the diagnosis of hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. In hereditary
            pyropoikilocytosis, the red cells demonstrate thermal autohaemolysis
            and increased osmotic fragility. The spectrin in normal red cells
            denatures at temperatures between 49ºC and 50ºC whereas in
            hereditary pyropoikilocytosis, the spectrin denatures at
            temperatures between 45ºC and 46ºC. Prolonged exposure at 37ºC will
            also induce fragmentation in hereditary pyropoikilocytosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The clinical course of hereditary pyropoikilocytosis is variable
            although the degree of haemolysis wanes with time. Splenectomy has
            been shown to improve the anaemia but has no effect on the abnormal
            red cell morphology.

          <p>
            Acute promyelocytic leukaemia may occur at any age although it
            predominantly occurs in adults. There are two types: the
            hypergranular or 'typical type' and the hypogranular or
            'microgranular' type. Both are characterised by the presence of
            abnormal promyelocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The
            promyelocytes in the hypergranular type have nuclei, which vary
            greatly in both size and shape. They are often bilobed and reniform
            or kidney shaped. The cytoplasm is densely packed with large
            azurophilic granules, which may obscure the nucleus. Auer rods and
            bundles of Auer rods (faggots) are invariably present. The
            promyelocytes in the microgranular type have the same characteristic
            nuclear shape however the cytoplasm shows a paucity or absence of
            granules. This is due to the submicroscopic size of the azurophilic
            granules. Auer rods and bundles of Auer rods may also be seen in the
            cytoplasm.
          </p>
          <p>The bone marrow in APL is hypercellular.</p>
          <p>
            The promyelocytes of APL contain procoagulant material which, when
            released into the circulation, causes disseminated intravascular
            coagulation (DIC). Coagulation studies should always be performed
            when a case of APL is suspected from the blood film.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flow cytometry performed on APL shows expression of the myeloid
            markers CD 33 (homogeneous and bright) and CD 13 (heterogeneous).
            HLA-DR and CD 34 are both negative, demonstrating the presence of a
            differentiating population of cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            The myeloperoxidase (MPO) reaction is strongly positive in both the
            hypergranular and hypogranular type. The reaction product often
            masks the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acute promyelocytic leukaemia shows the characteristic
            t(15;17)(q22;q12). This translocation results from the breakage and
            reunion of bands 15q22 and 17q12. It is a balanced translocation,
            which is both specific and diagnostic for acute promyelocytic
            leukaemia. The standard 15;17 translocation has been analysed in
            considerable molecular detail. It has been shown that, as a result
            of this translocation, the truncated retinoic acid receptor alpha
            gene (RAR<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif">α</span>)
            on chromosome17q12 has moved to chromosome 15q22, where it has fused
            with a gene called PML, giving rise to a new hybrid gene called
            PML-RAR<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif">α</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acute promyelocytic leukaemia stands alone when it comes to
            treatment. It responds to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) which
            induces remission by differentiating the leukaemic promyelocytes.
            This remarkable response to ATRA is directly related to the
            PML-RAR<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif">α</span>
            rearrangement in APL patients.
          </p>
          <p>Treatment with ATRA is combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p>
          <p>
            The World Health Organization (WHO) describes three variant
            translocations associated with APL. They are t(11;17)(q23;q21),
            t(5;17)(q32;q12) and t(11;17)(q13;q21).
          </p>
          <p>
            t(11;17)(q23;q21) is morphologically different from the other
            variant translocations in that the promyelocytes resemble the shape
            of normal promyelocytes. The nuclei are round. The cytoplasm is
            hypergranular and usually lacks Auer rods. There may be increased
            numbers of pelgeroid forms present. It also does not respond to
            treatment with ATRA.

          <p>
            What is Kawasaki disease? In 1967, Tomisaku Kawasaki, a Japanese
            paediatrician, described 50 children with fever lasting for more
            than 5 days. The children had cervical lymphadenopathy, rash,
            bilateral non-exudative conjunctivitis, swelling of the hands and
            feet and inflammation of the oral mucosa. The children ranged in age
            from 6-12 months. Kawasaki disease is more common amongst males with
            a male-to-female ratio of 1.5:1.
          </p>
          <p>
            The etiology of Kawasaki disease is still not understood. It is
            thought to be a multisystem vasculitic disorder. The onset of the
            fever is abrupt. It is a high, sustained fever, unresponsive to
            antibiotic therapy, lasting for a week or longer. During the acute
            phase, Kawasaki disease may cause medium and large vessel arteritis,
            arterial aneurysms, valvulitis and myocarditis. If untreated,
            approximately 20% of patients will develop coronary aneurysms.
            Kawasaki disease has surpassed rheumatic fever as the leading cause
            of heart disease in children less than 5 years of age.
          </p>
          <p>
            The medical management of Kawasaki disease involves the use of
            intravenous gamma globulin as well as aspirin, which is used as an
            anti-inflammatory agent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kawasaki disease is diagnosed from a combination of clinical and
            haematological features. Bacterial sepsis must always be excluded.
            Scientists working with paediatric patients should be ever mindful
            of this potentially fatal disease.

          <p><strong>Case Study 7</strong></p>
          <p>
            A 5 year old boy presents with malaise, pallor and fever. On
            clinical examination he has hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy.
            He also has neurofibromatosis. A full blood count is performed and
            the following results noted:
          </p>
          <p>
            Hb 99 g/L, WBC 27.4 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet count 206 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L
          </p>
          <p>
            The differential white cell count shows a left shift and a
            monocytosis of 11.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. A bone marrow aspiration is
            performed revealing an increase in myelopoiesis as well as a
            monocytosis. Cytogenetic studies demonstrate a monosomy 7. The HbF
            is raised at 6.4% (normal range for age is &lt;1%). A diagnosis of
            juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) is made.

          <p>
            JMML was classified as a myelodysplastic syndrome
            (MDS) by the FAB classification. The World Health
            Organization (WHO) removed JMML from the MDS
            classification and placed it in a new category,
            namely Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases
            (MDS/MPD).
          </p>
          <p>
            JMML typically presents in children less than 4
            years of age, with most cases occurring under the
            age of 2 years. The disease is more common in males
            than females (male to female ratio approximately
            2.5:1).
          </p>
          <p>
            JMML is a clonal disease characterized by an
            elevated WBC that is usually less than 100 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L with a left shift in the myeloid
            line. There is a peripheral monocytosis of more than
            1 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L with less than 20% blasts in
            the peripheral blood and bone marrow.
          </p>
          <p>The HbF is raised for the age of the child.</p>
          <p>
            The bone marrow is hypercellular with myeloid
            hyperplasia and decreased numbers of megakaryocytes.
            JMML lacks the Philadelphia chromosome or BCR / ABL
            fusion gene. Although cytogenetic abnormalities,
            including monosomy 7, occur in 30% to 40% of cases,
            no specific cytogenetic abnormality characterises
            JMML.
          </p>
          <p>
            JMML is associated with the autosomal dominant
            neurogenetic disorder neurofibromatosis. Children
            with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased
            risk for developing JMML.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most cases of JMML have a mean survival between 1
            and 2 years. Death is usually due to infection or
            progression of the disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approximately 10% to 20% of cases evolve to acute
            leukaemia. Long term remission can only be achieved
            with bone marrow transplantation.

          <p><strong>Case Study 8</strong></p>
          <p>
            A 10-month-old male child presented with a one-day
            history of fever. The child was noted to be pale and
            lethargic. A full blood count was performed and the
            following results were noted:
          </p>
          <p>
            Hb 40 g/L, MCV 99 fL (normal range for age 70-83
            fL), WCC 9.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet count
            42 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood film showed the presence of oval
            macrocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils and
            circulating megaloblasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further investigations revealed a low serum folate
            of 2.1 nmol/L (NR 5.5-33.3) and a low vitamin B<sub

            level of 103 pmol/L (NR 109-646). Iron studies were
            within normal limits.
          </p>
          <p>
            A diagnosis of megaloblastic anaemia secondary to
            nutritional folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>
            deficiency was made.

          <p>
            Megaloblastic anaemia in children is usually due to
            a lack of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid either
            through poor diet, increased cell turnover or
            malabsorption. Vitamin B12 and folic acid are
            prerequisites for DNA synthesis and thus the
            production of normocytic haematopoiesis. In their
            absence, the peripheral blood is characterised by
            the presence of oval macrocytes, teardrop
            poikilocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils.
            Basophilic stippling and Howell Jolly bodies may
            also be present. The mean cell volume in this child
            is raised for age.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bone marrow is hypercellular with increased
            numbers of megaloblasts which show asynchrony of
            nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation. The nuclei
            maintain a primitive, open chromatin pattern while
            the cytoplasm matures normally. Giant metamyelocytes
            and hypersegmented neutrophils are also present. The
            megakaryocytes show hypersegmented nuclei with an
            open chromatin pattern. Megaloblastic anaemia due to
            inadequate dietary intake may coexist with iron
            deficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in infancy may
            lead to irreversible neurological damage. Iron
            deficiency, often seen more commonly in this age
            group, can also result in less severe, but similarly
            irreversible neurological damage. Iron deficiency is
            usually secondary to excessive cow's milk and
            inadequate ingestion of solids.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further discussion with this child's parents
            revealed that the child was breast fed for the first
            2 weeks of life and was then fed a homemade formula
            of barley water, corn syrup and goat's milk. At the
            time of presentation, the child had not started on
            solids. Goats' milk is sometimes substituted for
            cows' milk, as it is less allergenic than cows'
            milk. Compared with breast milk, goat's milk has a
            very low concentration of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>,
            folic acid and iron.
          </p>
          <p>
            This child was transfused and given oral folate and
            vitamin B<sub>12</sub> injections. His fever was
            treated with antibiotics. At 5 months post
            presentation, he remains well.

          <p><strong>Case Study 9</strong></p>
          <p>
            A 15 year old male presented with lethargy, pallor
            and bleeding from the gums. A full blood count was
            performed with the following results:
          </p>
          <p>
            Hb 44 g/L, WCC 53.7 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet
            count 12 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L<br />
            The differential white cell count showed an absolute
            monocytosis of 10.7 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and a blast
            count of 22.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bone marrow examination revealed a hypercellular
            marrow with 74% blast cells. The blasts had a round
            to convoluted nuclear appearance with a fine
            chromatin pattern and one or more nucleoli. The
            cytoplasm was basophilic and lacked granules.
            Morphologically, they resembled monoblasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flow cytometry was performed on the marrow, which
            had the following immunophenotype:
          </p>
          <p>
            CD13<sup>+</sup>/CD33<sup>+</sup>/CD3<sup>4-</sup>/CD117<sup>+</sup>/HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>/TdT<sup>–</sup>/MPO<sup

            CD14<sup>–</sup>/CD64<sup>+</sup>/CD116<sup>+</sup>
            (monocytoid markers) </p>

            <p>The markers were suggestive of acute myeloid
            leukaemia with monocytic differentiation. As the
            blasts clearly resembled monoblasts morphologically,
            a combined esterase stain was performed. The blasts
            were positive with the <span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math', serif">α</span>-naphthyl acetate esterase
            stain and negative with the AS-D chloroacetate
            esterase stain.<br />
            The overwhelming brown reaction, as seen below,
            confirmed the morphological diagnosis of acute
            monoblastic leukaemia.

          <p>
            The WHO classification of acute monoblastic
            leukaemia, synonymous with M5a in the FAB
            classification, occurs at any age but most commonly
            occurs in young adults. The majority of cases
            present with bleeding gums secondary to gingival
            infiltration. Acute monoblastic leukaemia and acute
            monocytic leukaemia are myeloid leukaemias
            characterised by 80% or more cells of the monocytic
            lineage. In acute monoblastic leukaemia, at least
            80% of the cells are monoblasts and in acute
            monocytic leukaemia, at least 80% of the cells are
            promonocytes and monocytes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Monoblasts</em> have rounded nuclei with a fine
            chromatin pattern and one or two prominent nucleoli.
            The cytoplasm is basophilic and lacks granules.
            <em>Promonocytes</em> show some differentiation in
            the maturation of the nucleus, which is indented and
            often contains a nucleolus. The cytoplasm is
            blue-grey and may contain a few fine azurophilic
            granules as well as vacuoles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monoblasts and promonocytes usually show -naphthyl
            acetate esterase positivity. In 10-20% of cases, the
            a-naphthyl acetate esterase stain is negative or
            weakly positive and immunophenotyping may be
            necessary to make a diagnosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most common cytogenetic rearrangement associated
            with acute monoblastic leukaemia is
            t(8;16)(p11;p13). While the immunophenotype should
            show some markers characteristic of monocytic
            differentiation:
          </p>
          <p>
            CD13<sup>+</sup>, CD33<sup>+</sup>,
            CD34<sup>-</sup>, CD117<sup>+</sup> (myeloid
            markers)<br />
            CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup>,
            CD11e<sup>+</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup>,
            CD36<sup>+</sup>, CD64<sup>+</sup>, CD68<sup>+</sup>
            (monocytoid markers)</p>
            <p>Many cases of acute monoblastic leukaemia will not
            express CD14, as it is a marker of monocytic
            differentiation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acute monoblastic and acute monocytic leukaemia
            usually have an aggressive clinical course.
            Prognosis is usually poor.
          </p>
          <p>
            This particular case demonstrates the necessity to
            use all the available tools, namely, morphology,
            cytogenetics, immunophenotype and cytochemistry to
            make the correct diagnosis.

          <p>
            A 3-year-old child presented with pallor and
            lethargy. A full blood count was performed and the
            following results were noted:

            Hb 43 g/L, MCV 75.3 fL, WCC 5.3 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L
            and platelet count 302 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the white cell count was normal, the
            differential revealed a mild neutropenia of 1.0 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L.
          </p>
          <p>
            A haemolytic screen was performed: the reticulocyte
            count was 0.1%, the bilirubin
          </p>
          <p>
            10 umol/L and the serum lactate dehydrogenase 202
            IU/L. Initial serology testing for parvovirus B19
            infection was negative.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bone marrow examination revealed a mildly
            hypocellular marrow with marked erythroid
            hypoplasia. Myeloid maturation, despite a mild
            neutropenia, was normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Hb and reticulocyte count improved
            spontaneously within a few days, a diagnosis of

          <p>
            There are 3 major causes of red cell aplasia
            occurring in childhood. They are namely:
          </p>
          <ol class="custom-list">
            <li>
              Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA) or pure red cell
              aplasia
            </li>
            <li>
              Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC)
            </li>
            <li>
              Acute aplastic crisis superimposed on chronic
              haemolytic anaemia. This form of red cell aplasia
              may occur in adults as well as in children.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p>
            In 1970, Wranne described 4 children with temporary
            red cell aplasia. This phenomenon became known as
            ‘transient erythroblastopenia of childhood’ or TEC.
            TEC commonly presents at 2 years of age, although it
            can present as young as 6 months of age. The
            clinical presentation of TEC is essentially normal
            except for the appearance of pallor and signs of
            anaemia such as tachycardia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hb levels are variable with a mean of 56 g/L and
            a reticulocyte count below 1.0%. If the patient is
            already in the recovery phase, which frequently
            occurs, the reticulocyte count will be higher. TEC
            is often associated with a neutropenia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bone marrow examination reveals a normocellular
            marrow with erythroid hypoplasia. Myeloid maturation
            is normal despite the frequent association with
            neutropenia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Serum lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin and serum
            haptoglobin levels are normal in TEC and there is
            usually no evidence of an associated parvovirus B19
            infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recovery is denoted by a rise in the reticulocyte
            count, an increase in the MCV and RDW and a reversal
            of the neutropenia. Spontaneous, complete recovery,
            usually occurs within one month of presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no specific treatment for TEC. The
            administration of intravenous IgG or corticosteroids
            is not indicated.
