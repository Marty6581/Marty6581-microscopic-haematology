        <div class="section-content">
          <p><strong>Case Study 11</strong></p>
          <p>
            Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder
            characterised by the destruction of antibody-sensitised platelets by
            macrophages, most notably in the spleen. It is primarily a diagnosis
            of exclusion as it is made after conditions associated with
            secondary thrombocytopenia have been excluded. There are 2 forms of
            ITP, acute and chronic. Acute ITP usually occurs in children between
            the age of 2 and 6 years. It is often preceded by vaccination or by
            a viral infection. Chronic ITP usually occurs in children more than
            10 years of age, as well as in adults.
          </p>
          <p>
            ITP is caused by autoantibodies interacting with platelet membrane
            glycoproteins and resulting in accelerated destruction of platelets.
            As these autoantibodies diminish in strength and finally disappear,
            the platelet count returns to normal. This process takes up to 6
            months in children with acute ITP and takes even longer in children
            with chronic ITP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acute ITP is characterised by platelet counts less than 20 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L and often less than 10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. The
            clinical presentation is bruising with a petechial rash in an
            otherwise healthy child. Acute ITP affects males and females
            equally. Chronic ITP is characterised by a somewhat higher platelet
            count, less than 150 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and occurs predominantly in
            females by a 2:1 ratio.
          </p>
          <p>
            A full blood count, including platelet count, should be performed on
            all children suspected of having ITP. Features inconsistent with ITP
            should prompt further investigations. A bone marrow biopsy reveals
            normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes in both acute and
            chronic ITP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acute ITP is a self-limiting disorder requiring minimal or no
            therapy in the majority of cases. Corticosteroids or Intragam (IgG)
            may be given at the discretion of the clinician. Chronic ITP is also
            treated with corticosteroids or Intragam and may, in some cases,
            ultimately require splenectomy.
          </p>
          <p>
            An 8-year-old boy presented at the Paediatric Casualty Department
            with multiple bruises and mucocutaneous bleeding. He is said to have
            had a history of ITP. A full blood count was performed with the
            following results:
          </p>
          <p>
            Hb 125 g/L, WCC 5.9 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet count 52 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examination of the blood film revealed the presence of large and
            giant platelets. The low platelet count and abnormal platelet
            morphology prompted further investigation including platelet
            aggregation studies. The result of these studies revealed normal
            platelet aggregation with ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid and
            adrenaline and absent platelet aggregation with ristocetin.
            Monoclonal antibody typing of platelet glycoprotein analysed by flow
            cytometry revealed a reduction in the number of Transient
            erythroblastopenia of childhood GpIb/IX complexes. These results are
            consistent with the disorder known as Bernard Soulier Syndrome
            (BSS).

          <p>
            BSS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by a
            moderate thrombocytopenia. The platelets are giant sized and
            morphologically abnormal. Platelet aggregation is normal with ADP,
            collagen and adrenaline. There is a delayed response with thrombin
            and absent platelet aggregation with human VWF and ristocetin. The
            platelet membrane shows deficiency in the GpIb/IX complex when
            analysed by flow cytometry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patients with BSS usually present early in life. Clinically, they
            present with bruising, bleeding from mucous membranes and epistaxis.
            Adult females suffer from menorrhagia. The platelet count is only
            moderately reduced with total counts between 50 and 100 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L. The bleeding time is prolonged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forms of treatment include hormonal management in females,
            administration of DDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) to
            increase the level of circulating VWF and the administration of
            activated factor VIIa in emergency situations. Platelet transfusions
            have proved unsuccessful as alloantibodies to components of the
            GpIb/IX complex often lead to refractive platelet therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            This case study demonstrates the importance of assessing platelet
            numbers and morphology as well as performing other relevant tests
            prior to making a diagnosis of ITP.

          <p>
            Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus
            associated with 3 distinct disease states, namely, gas gangrene or
            clostridial myonecrosis, enteritis necroticans and clostridium food
            poisoning. Clostridium perfringens is a saprophytic organism
            inhabiting the bowel and genital tract. It has no pathophysiological
            significance in the absence of clinical infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clostridium perfringens produces at least 12 antigenic protein
            toxins, the most common of which is the alpha toxin. These toxins
            react with lipoprotein complexes on cell surfaces, liberating potent
            haemolytic substances known as lysolecithins resulting in cell
            lysis. This process leads to a haemolytic anaemia, which may be so
            severe, the end result is death. During this process of cell lysis,
            large amounts of CO2 and hydrogen are produced. This leads to
            intense abdominal swelling hence the term gas gangrene. A
            foul-smelling odour is given off from the necrotic tissue.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a patient presents with bowel perforation, clostridia are
            released into the surrounding tissues, giving rise to tissue
            necrosis. This process is a rapid one proceeding up to 10cm per
            hour. The patient develops severe haemolytic anaemia.
            Haemoglobinemia and haemoglobinuria occur. The serum becomes a
            brilliant red colour resulting in dissociation between the
            haemoglobin and the haematocrit level. A leucocytosis with a left
            shift as well as a thrombocytopenia is present. Acute renal and
            hepatic failure develops leading to death in as short a period as 12
            hours if not treated immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no specific treatment available for Clostridium
            perfringens. The basis of treatment is surgical debridement of
            necrotic tissue and antibiotic therapy. In severe infections,
            hyperbaric oxygen is an important adjunct if available. Massive
            doses of benzylpenicillin are administered intravenously in cases of
            clostridial sepsis. Should the patient be allergic to penicillin,
            metronidazole is effective in high doses.
          </p>
          <p>The above patient died 48 hours post admission to hospital.</p>

          <p>
            SMZL is a rare B-cell lymphoma occurring in elderly
            patients. It comprises less than 1% of all the
            lymphoid neoplasms. SMZL is characterised by a large
            spleen while lymphadenopathy is rare. The bone
            marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) are often
            involved. The PB shows a moderate lymphocytosis with
            white cell counts of less than 25 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L. The lymphocytes appear as villous
            lymphocytes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Morphologically these lymphocytes range from small
            to medium in size with round to irregular shaped
            nuclei, coarse chromatin pattern, an occasional
            nucleolus and abundant pale blue cytoplasm. The
            cytoplasm may exhibit fine projections or villi
            confined to one pole of the cell. Some of the
            lymphocytes may appear plasmacytoid.
          </p>
          <p>
            The differential diagnosis includes other small
            B-cell lymphomas/leukaemias including chronic
            lymphatic leukaemia, hairy cell leukaemia, mantle
            cell, follicular and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
          </p>
          <p>
            Immunophenotyping shows strong expression of surface
            immunoglobulin (SIg) and positivity for B-cell
            antigens (CD19, CD20 and CD22). HLA-DR and FMC7 are
            also positive. CD5 is variable; CD10 and CD103 are
            negative although in 6% of cases CD103 may be
            positive. CD23 is negative to weak positive. CD11c
            and CD25 may be either positive or negative. The
            absence of CD5 is useful in excluding chronic
            lymphatic leukaemia; the absence of CD103 is useful
            in excluding hairy cell leukaemia while the absence
            of CD10 is useful in excluding follicular lymphoma.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst immunophenotyping is helpful in the diagnosis
            of SMZL, no one marker is specific in distinguishing
            it from other B-cell lymphomas/leukaemias. Once
            again morphology plays an important role in making
            the correct diagnosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most commonly seen cytogenetic abnormalities in
            SMZL are loss of chromosome 7q 21-32 occurring in
            40% of cases; t(11;14)(q13;q32) occurring in 5-10%
            of cases as well as trisomy 3 occurring in about 20%
            of cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clinically, SMZL is recognised as being in the
            category of an indolent lymphoma. Response to
            chemotherapy is poor compared to other chronic
            lymphoid leukaemias/lymphomas. Patients with SMZL
            typically have a good response to splenectomy with
            long term survival.

          <p>
            An 11-year-old male presented to the Casualty
            Department with an anterior mediastinal mass.
          </p>
          <p>
            A full blood count was performed with the following
            results:<br />
            Hb 98 g/L, WBC 37.5 x 109/L and platelet count 35 x
            109/L.
          </p>
          <p>
            A differential white cell count showed an absolute
            lymphocytosis with 64% lymphoblasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            A diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
            was made from the blood film.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bone marrow and trephine biopsies were performed.
            (See Figure 1)
          </p>
          <p>
            A morphological examination of the peripheral blood
            revealed two populations of lymphoblasts. There were
            small blasts with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic
            ratio, dense chromatin pattern and inconspicuous
            nucleoli and larger heterogeneous blasts with
            cleaved nuclei, fine chromatin and prominent
            nucleoli.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bone marrow biopsy resulted in a dry tap. This
            is often the case, especially in children. The
            marrow was densely packed with blast cells and
            fibrous tissue making aspiration impossible. The
            trephine revealed a bone marrow packed with blasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cytochemistry and immunophenotyping were performed
            on the bone marrow. The blasts showed focal
            positivity with the acid phosphatase stain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Immunophenotyping showed the following results:<br />
            HLA-DR-, CD3-, CD19-, CD117-, CD2+, CD4-, CD5+,
            CD7+, CD8+, CD34+, TdT+, CD1a+, Cyto3+

            Approximately eighty percent of childhood acute
            leukaemias are lymphoblastic of which eighty to
            eighty five percent have the B-progenitor phenotype.
            Children with Precursor B-Cell ALL are usually
            younger children under six years of age.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ten to fifteen percent of children with acute
            lymphoblastic leukaemia, usually older children and
            adolescents, present with Precursor T-Cell ALL.
          </p>
          <p>
            T-Cell ALL almost invariably presents with a high
            white cell count and bulky extramedullary disease.
            The children have a lymphadenopathy,
            hepatosplenomegaly and an anterior mediastinal
            thymic mass.
          </p>
          <p>
            T-Cell ALL may also present with central nervous
            system (CNS) involvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eighty to eighty five percent of children with
            B-Cell ALL go into remission and remain relapse-free
            survivors. T-Cell ALL children usually relapse early
            into their treatment and are transplanted as soon as
            remission is achieved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The patient in this case study had a bone marrow
            transplant early into the course of his treatment.
            He remained well for eighteen months. He then
            presented with increased intracranial pressure,
            vomiting, headache, papilledema and lethargy. A CSF
            specimen revealed CNS involvement. (See Figure 2)

            A bone marrow biopsy was performed. The marrow was
            found to be clear of leukaemia. This is often the
            case in CNS relapse.
          </p>
          <p>
            His CNS leukaemia was treated with intrathecal

          <p>
            Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a clonal
            disorder closely resembling chronic myeloid
            leukaemia (CML). It is characterised by a persistent
            monocytosis of &gt;1 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L in the peripheral
            blood; absence of the Philadelphia chromosome and
            BCR/ABL fusion gene; dysplasia involving one or more
            cell lineages and &lt; 20% blasts in the bone
            marrow. CMML occurs predominantly in patients over
            50 years old. The peripheral blood is characterised
            by a monocytosis, usually in the range of 2-5 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L. The percentage of monocytes is almost always
            &gt;10% of the total white blood cell count. The
            monocytes are mature and often display abnormal
            nuclear morphology. Blasts and promonocytes account
            for approximately 20% of the white cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            The total white cell count may be normal or slightly
            decreased.
          </p>
          <p>
            A neutropenia or neutrophilia may be present.
            Neutrophil precursors usually comprise fewer than
            10% of the total white cell count.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some cases of CMML are associated with an
            eosinophilia. The eosinophil count is &gt;1.5 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L. Elevated eosinophil counts may be
            associated with tissue damage secondary to
            degranulation of the eosinophils.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dysplasia is a feature of all three cell lineages
            occurring in both the peripheral blood and bone
            marrow. Dysgranulopoiesis: hypolobulated or
            abnormally lobulated nuclei with abnormal
            cytoplasmic granulation of the monocytes.
            Dyserythropoiesis: normocytic/macrocytic red cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dysmegakaryopoiesis: thrombocytopenia with atypical
            large platelets.
          </p>
          <p>
            CMML is divided into two categories according to the
            number of blasts in the peripheral blood and bone
            marrow. CMML-1: &lt;5% blasts in the peripheral
            blood and &lt;10% blasts in the bone marrow.
          </p>
          <p>
            CMML-2: 5-19% blasts in the peripheral blood and
            10-19% blasts in the bone marrow. More than 20%
            blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow are
            indicative of acute myeloid leukaemia rather than
            CMML.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bone marrow in CMML is hypercellular with
            proportionally more promonocytes than monocytes.
            Often the myeloid hyperplasia of the marrow tends to
            mask the monocytosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Immunophenotype:</em><br />
            The peripheral blood and bone marrow cells express
            the typical myelomonocytic antigens, namely:<br />
            CD13 and CD33 (myeloid)<br />
            CD14, CD64 and CD68 (monocytoid)
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Cytogenetics:</em><br />
            There is no Philadelphia chromosome in CMML.<br />
            Cytogenetic abnormalities occur in 20-40% of cases
            of CMML:<br />
            +8, -7del(7q) or del(20q).
          </p>
          <p>
            The median survival of patients with CMML is 20-40
            months. Progression to acute leukaemia occurs in
            approximately 15-30% of cases.

            the face.
          </p>
          <p>
            A full blood count was performed and the following
            results noted:<br />
            Hb 84 g/L, WBC 15.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, Platelet
            count 422 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and Reticulocyte count
            0.6 %.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood film showed a normochromic normocytic
            anaemia with a reticulocytopenia.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Hb EPG was performed with no abnormality detected.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bone marrow examination revealed an
            erythroblastopenia together with giant
            proerythroblasts scattered throughout the marrow.
            Such findings may be associated with a parvovirus
            infection.
          </p>
          <p>Parvovirus serology was performed:</p>
          <p>
            Parvovirus B19 IgG and parvovirus B19 IgM were both

          <p>
            The human parvovirus was discovered in 1975 in the
            sera of normal blood donors whilst screening for the
            hepatitis B virus. The term parvovirus is derived
            from the Latin ‘parvum’ meaning ‘small’.
            Parvoviruses are amongst the smallest DNA containing
            viruses infecting man. They are extremely stable,
            resisting heat inactivation at 56ºC for more than 60
            minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parvovirus infection is a common infection in
            humans. Approximately 50% of children have
            detectable parvovirus B19 IgG in their blood by the
            age of fifteen and more than 90% of the elderly are
            also seropositive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parvovirus has an unusual predilection for
            rapidly growing cells, particularly red cell
            precursors in the bone marrow. It uses the P antigen
            as a receptor to enter the red cell. The P antigen
            is also present on granulocytes and megakaryocytes.
            Once inside the cell the parvovirus inhibits growth
            by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This
            process gives rises to a severe haemolytic anaemia
            when the red cells are infected. When the
            granulocytes and megakaryocytes are infected an
            aplastic crisis may occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parvovirus infection is also responsible for causing
            aplastic crises in children with a chronic
            haemolytic state such as hereditary spherocytosis.
            It can produce prolonged pancytopenia in an
            otherwise healthy child and frequently produces a
            prolonged pancytopenia in children with deficient
            immunity such as thalassaemia, hereditary
            pyropoikilocytosis, pyruvate kinase deficiency and
            autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parvovirus is transmitted in the form of
            droplets. It may also enter the body via other
            routes including transfusion with contaminated blood
            products.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no specific treatment for patients with
            parvovirus B19.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remission usually occurs within one to two weeks
            post infection. An increase in the number of
            granulocytes, platelets and finally reticulocytes
            indicates the return of normal bone marrow function.
            Severe anaemia may require transfusion of red blood
            cells.

          <p><strong>Case Study 17</strong></p>
          <p>
            A 3-year-old child from Southeast Asia presents with
            pallor and fatigue at the paediatric casualty
            department. She is said to have a history of alpha
            thalassaemia, namely haemoglobin H disease (HbH).
          </p>
          <p>
            A full blood count is performed with the following
            results:
          </p>
          <p>
            Hb 78 g/L, MCV 75.3 fL, MCH 20.8 pg, Platelet count
            358 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L
          </p>
          <p>
            A blood film is examined with the following
            morphology:
          </p>
          <p>
            Anisocytosis, microcytes, hypochromasia,
            elliptocytes, polychromasia, target cells and coarse
            basophilic stippling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Morphologically the blood film is not suggestive of
            HbH disease. Coarse basophilic stippling is not a
            feature of HbH disease. Also the MCV and MCH are
            higher than that seen in HbH disease.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alpha thalassaemias are caused by a decrease in the
            production of alpha globin genes. This decrease in
            alpha genes is due to a deletion or mutation of one
            or more of the four alpha Aglobin genes located on
            chromosome 16.
          </p>
          <p>
            The alpha thalassaemias are divided into four
            groups:
          </p>
          <p>
            One gene deletion - silent trait<br />
            Two gene deletion - thalassaemia trait<br />
            Three gene deletion - HbH disease<br />
            Four gene deletion - hydrops foetalis
          </p>
          <p>
            The silent carriers have no clinical abnormalities.
            The haemoglobin level is within the normal range
            while the MCV is borderline normal. Those with alpha
            thalassaemia trait are clinically normal however the
            haemoglobin is low while the indicies are microcytic
            and hypochromic. The average MCV is 68 fL and the
            average MCH is
          </p>
          <p>
            21 pg. Those with HbH disease are also clinically
            normal however their haemoglobin level is moderately
            low. The average MCV is 57 fL and the average MCH is
            21 pg. Those with hydrops foetalis fail to produce
            alpha globin chains. They have four gamma chains or
            haemoglobin Barts. Also they are delivered
            stillborn, usually at 30 to 40 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Haemoglobin H disease can be associated with a rare
            haemoglobin known as Haemoglobin Constant Spring
            (HbCS). HbCS is an alpha chain variant rather than a
            deletion. The alpha chain is elongated by 31
            additional amino acid residues at the C-terminal
            end, making it very unstable. The presence of HbCS
            causes the red cells to break down faster than usual
            giving rise to a severe anaemia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The red cells of HbCS are large and different from
            those seen in any of the other forms of
            thalassaemia. The cells are markedly overhydrated
            relative to those of the deletional forms of alpha
            thalassaemia. This phenomenon is expressed early in
            erythroid maturation and is fully expressed at the
            reticulocyte stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the MCV and MCH of our patient did not support a
            clinical diagnosis of HbH disease alone, it was
            decided to perform a haemoglobin EPG. The results
            are as follows:
          </p>
          <div>
            <table class="table">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Hb A2</td>
                  <td>1.4%</td>
                  <td>NR (&lt;1)</td>

                  <td>3.3%</td>
                  <td>NR (&lt;1)</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>
          <p>
            Haemoglobin H inclusions detected.<br />
            Abnormal bands of HbH, Hb Barts and Hb Constant
            Spring detected.
          </p>
          <p>
            A diagnosis of HbH-CS was confirmed on this patient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clinically, HbH-CS is more severe than HbH disease.
            Patients with HbH-CS have a moderate to severe
            anaemia and ultimately develop complications such as
            an enlarged spleen. Some need blood transfusions
            from time to time, especially when they develop a
            fever for example, while others need to be
            transfused more frequently.

            A full blood count is performed. The patient is
            severely pancytopenic: Hb 110 g/L, WBC 0.43 x
            10<sup>9</sup>/L and Platelet count 14 x

          <p>
            Dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fevers are
            acute febrile diseases found in the tropics and
            Africa with a geographical spread similar to that of
            malaria. One major difference is that while malaria
            is not found in major cities, dengue occurs in
            developed tropical nations including Singapore,
            Taiwan, Fiji, Indonesia and Brazil. It is also found
            in northern Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any one of four closely related virus serotypes of
            the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, causes
            dengue fever.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dengue fever is transmitted to humans by the Aedes
            Aegypti mosquito.
          </p>
          <p>
            The clinical features of dengue are a sudden onset
            of fever, severe headache, muscle and joint pain and
            a petechial rash on the lower limbs and chest. There
            may also be gastritis with abdominal pain, nausea,
            vomiting and diarrhoea.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fever lasts about six to seven days. The
            platelet count steadily drops during the period of
            fever. The platelet count returns to normal as the
            temperature returns to normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Treatment is supportive therapy. A platelet
            transfusion is indicated if the platelet count drops
            significantly as is a blood transfusion if the
            haemoglobin is low secondary to malaena indicative
            of gastrointestinal bleeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dengue fever is the most important mosquito-borne
            disease affecting humans after malaria. Some forty
            million cases of dengue fever and several hundred
            thousand cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever are
            reported every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although dengue fever is not diagnostic from the
            blood film, a rapidly progressive thrombocytopenia
            together with the presence of 'Turk' cells is highly
            suggestive of the viral infection.

            Cytogenetics were performed. In addition to the
            presence of trisomy 21 found in Down syndrome there
            was an additional chromosome 8 (trisomy 8).

            Newborn infants with Down syndrome have an increased
            disposition for acute leukaemia. The leukaemia is
            predominantly acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia.
            Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia may occur but is less
            common.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acute leukaemia in the newborn is initially labelled
            as TAM.
          </p>
          <p>
            TAM is characterised by an uncontrolled
            proliferation of blast cells that regress
            spontaneously over weeks and months. However, in 25
            to 30 percent of cases TAM will persist, in which
            case a diagnosis of congenital acute leukaemia will
            be made. Approximately 25 percent of cases with TAM
            will go on to develop acute megakaryoblastic
            leukaemia by the age of three years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leukaemia associated with Down syndrome is often
            preceded by a myelodysplastic-like syndrome, as is
            the case in this patient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most children with Down syndrome and acute myeloid
            leukaemia have an abnormal karyotype, most commonly
            trisomy 8 or less commonly trisomy 1 and 19 or
            tetrasomy 21.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the absolute blast cell count on this infant was
            extremely high, chemotherapy was commenced. Low-dose
            of cytarabine therapy was administered. The infant
            responded well initially but relapsed some weeks
            later before dying from its disease.

          <p><strong>Case Study 20</strong></p>
          <p>
            A 16-year-old male presented to the paediatric
            casualty department with a mass on the left-hand
            side of his face. He was otherwise feeling well. A
            full blood count was performed with the following
            results:<br />
            Hb 107 g/L, WBC 10.2 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet
            count 53 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood film showed a leucoerythroblastic blood
            picture with 2% myelocytes, 54% blasts and 2 NRBC’s
            / 100 WBC's. The red cells showed the presence of
            teardrop poikilocytes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bone marrow biopsy was performed. It was
            hypercellular with 80% blast cells. The blasts were
            medium in size, containing round nuclei with a fine
            chromatin pattern and nucleoli. The cytoplasm was
            deeply basophilic and contained many
            lipid-containing vacuoles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flow cytometry and cytogenetics were performed on
            the bone marrow sample with the following results:

          <p>
            Burkitt lymphoma/leukaemia is classified under
            mature B-cell neoplasms by the World Health
            Organization (WHO). Burkitt lymphoma is a highly
            aggressive lymphoma, often occurring at extra-nodal
            sites. It is referred to as Burkitt cell leukaemia
            when the bone marrow is involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three clinical variants of Burkitt cell
            lymphoma:
          </p>
          <p>
            Endemic Burkitt cell lymphoma: this variant occurs
            in equatorial Africa and Papua New Guinea. It is the
            most common malignancy of childhood occurring in
            children between the age of four and seven years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma: this variant occurs
            throughout the world. Occurring mainly in children
            and young adults, it is associated with the Epstein
            Barr virus (EBV).
          </p>
          <p>
            Immunodeficiency associated Burkitt lymphoma: this
            variant is primarily associated with the human
            immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
          </p>
          <p>
            Clinical presentation:<br />
            The clinical presentation varies according to the
            particular variant. The majority of patients with
            the sporadic variant present with an abdominal mass
            while those with the immunodeficiency associated
            variant present with nodal and bone marrow
            involvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            All three variants may be associated with central
            nervous system disease (CNS).
          </p>
          <p>
            Immunophenotype:<br />
            The blast cells of Burkitt lymphoma are B cells
            expressing CD19, CD20, and CD22. Unlike the blasts
            of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,
            they are mature cells; they are TdT and CD34
            negative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cytogenetics:<br />
            The variants of Burkitt lymphoma are associated with
            a t(8;22)(q24;q11) and a t(2;8)(p12;q24).
          </p>
          <p>
            Treatment:<br />
            Although highly aggressive, the endemic and sporadic
            variants are potentially curable. Treatment should
            be commenced as soon as possible after diagnosis due
            to the short doubling time of the tumour.
          </p>
          <p>
            Treatment of Burkitt cell leukaemia involves
            intensive chemotherapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            CNS involvement is often a complication of the
            disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three months post commencement of treatment, the
            above patient presented with CNS disease. His CSF
            was heavily infiltrated with leukaemic blast cells.
            He died some weeks later.
