        <p>
          The third edition provides over 400 full colour haematological slides
          of exceptional quality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Arranged in a logical order, it commences with the red cell series
          describing normoblastic erythropoiesis and then goes on to describe
          abnormal erythropoiesis and all the red cell disorders associated with
          anaemia. Each type of anaemia is described with a minimal amount of
          text and accompanied by coloured haematological slides depicting the
          red cell changes associated with the particular disorder. The images
          have been magnified x 1000 and are of a very high quality. The
          platelet section follows on and adheres to the same format.

          Microscopic Haematology - A practical guide for the laboratory by
          Gillian Rozenberg. There is a section on haematology relating to
          paediatrics which describes red cell, white cell and platelet
          disorders occurring in cord blood, the neonate and childhood. The last
          section is on Blood Parasites and describes the four species of human
          malaria. A description of the characteristic features of each species
          as it occurs in the red cell is accompanied by images clearly
          depicting the various stages of maturation of each species of malaria.

        <h3>Review:</h3>
        <p>
          This is the third edition of this most professionally and expertly
          presented atlas of haematology. The first edition was published in
          1996 followed by the second in 2003. Once again, a standout feature of
          the book is the exceptionally high-quality illustrations. The
          supporting text is thorough yet concise and always relevant.
        </p>

        <p>
          The third edition includes 92 additional images detailing cell
          morphology and ultra-structure, resulting in over 400 photomicrographs
          of slides in total. There is also online access for students to free
          learning resources and activities to supplement the learning material
          in the book (Evolve). For instructors, there is online access to case
          studies relating to the illustrations contained in the book that would
          be very helpful as a teaching tool.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gillian Rozenberg FAIMS is an acknowledged authority on blood cell
          morphology and has once again utilized her knowledge and expertise to
          produce an invaluable volume for reference in the medical laboratory
          and for students in the field of haematology.
        </p>

        <p>
          This book contains four sections. The first section includes
          erythropoiesis, anaemias, haemoglobin disorders, membrane disorders,
          and miscellaneous. The second section, dealing with leucocytes and
          platelets, covers maturation, abnormal cells, neoplasms, and includes
          special stains where warranted. The third section on paediatric
          haematology covers cord blood, red cell disorders, bone marrow
          failure, benign disorders of leucocytes, myeloproliferative neoplasms,
          non-haemopoietic malignancies, storage disorders, and platelet
          abnormalities. The fourth section deals with blood parasites,
          including the four generally recognized species of human malaria and
          also <em>Plasmodium knowlesi</em>, now recognized as a fifth species
          infecting humans, as well as non-malarial blood parasites.
        </p>

        <p>
          The text in all sections includes accurate and succinct descriptions,
          and the illustrations are always relevant and have been reproduced to
          represent faithfully what would be seen when viewed microscopically.
          In the main, the detail of the slides is excellent, and the cell
          structure/inclusions are very clear; however, some of the
          illustrations for the fourth section dealing with malarial parasites
          are a little too small for enough detail to be seen.
        </p>

        <p>
          The descriptions of neoplasms in this edition are classified according
          to the generally accepted fourth edition of the WHO Classification of
          Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. Cytogenetic and
          cytochemical/immunophenotypic details are included where applicable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having spent much of my career in the Haematology Department of a
          large metropolitan children's hospital, I know too well that
          paediatric haematology, both normal and abnormal, is significantly
          different from that seen in adults. The inclusion of a chapter
          dedicated to the detailed description of paediatric haematology is
          most welcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          The book does not purport to be a haematology textbook, and nor is it.
          The minimalist texts assist the student of haematology in identifying
          and recognizing the morphological features; however, there is little
          or no explanation of the underlying cellular and physiological
          mechanisms which give rise to those morphological abnormalities. For
          example, the shortened red cell life span in lead poisoning is
          mentioned but not elucidated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps references to suitable texts could be incorporated. Labelling
          of the features in the photomicrographs would also be a welcome
          improvement. In addition, a glossary of terms would add value; for
          example, burr cells appear in figure A3-17 with no previous mention or
          description.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Recommendation:</strong> I would recommend this practical
          guide as an absolute must for all laboratories and teaching
          institutions. It provides an exceptional resource for remote
          laboratories and will prove invaluable for training students who will
          appreciate the e-learning feature and the book’s very competitive
          price. The compact size makes the book easy to use next to the
          microscope, especially when compared to other atlases.

            <p>
              <strong>A Practical Guide for the Laboratory, 2nd Edition</strong
              ><br />
              <em>By Gillian Rozenberg</em>
            </p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              This is the second edition of a comprehensive atlas of the
              microscopic appearance of a variety of disorders detected in the
              peripheral blood and bone marrow.
            </p>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
              The purpose is to provide a comprehensive guide to the microscopic
              appearance of a variety of hematological disorders and other
              disorders that cause abnormalities in the peripheral blood or bone
              marrow. Improvements from the first edition include the addition
              of pediatric hematology as well as use of the World Health
              Organization (WHO) classification of primary hematological
              disorders. The author has clearly succeeded in her worthy goals.
            </p>

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
              This book would be very useful for practicing clinical laboratory
              scientists (CLSs), pathologists, and clinical hematologists. It
              would be of interest to medical and CLS students,
              pathology/laboratory medicine residents, and anyone interested in
              clinical microscopy.
            </p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>
              This half-inch thick, paperback book contains a wealth of
              hematology information. The photomicrographs are absolutely
              first-rate, with excellent color and definition. Everything that
              could possibly be detected in peripheral blood—from primary
              malignant hematological disorders to congenital hematological
              disorders to infectious agents—is represented in this book.
            </p>

            <p>
              An extremely helpful feature is the use of the WHO classification
              for primary hematological disorders, accompanied by a brief
              description of the associated immunophenotypic and karyotypic
              abnormalities. The pediatric hematology section was a nice
              addition and is also very well done.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are few things that captivate a
              hematologist/hematopathologist as much as a beautiful and
              comprehensive atlas of microscopic images of the vast spectrum of
              abnormalities detected by clinical microscopy. This book will
              astound and please many a hematologist/hematopathologist. I was
              personally awestruck with the sheer depth and breadth of this book
              as well as the beauty of the photomicrographs.
            </p>

            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>
              This is one of the best annotated microscopic atlases for
              disorders detected in the peripheral blood or bone marrow that
              I've encountered to date. Its small size and ready portability
              make it that much more appealing. <strong>Get it!</strong>

              <em
                >Microscopic Haematology: A Practical Guide for the
                Laboratory</em
              >
              was first published in 1996. The second edition has been well
              received, with its high-quality illustrations and clear, concise
              text. Its publication is timely, as it describes the neoplastic
              diseases of the lymphoid and haemopoietic tissues using the
              recently introduced and now almost universally accepted World
              Health Organization (WHO) classification.
            </p>

            <p>
              This edition has been expanded to include a section on paediatric
              haematology covering cord blood, red cell disorders, bone marrow
              failure, benign disorders of leucocytes, myeloproliferative
              disorders, non-haemopoietic malignancies, storage disorders, and
              platelet abnormalities.
            </p>

            <h3>Content & Classification</h3>
            <p>
              As stated by the author, a full description of the WHO
              classification of the neoplastic diseases of the lymphoid and
              haemopoietic tissues is beyond this book’s scope. However, the
              author does an excellent job of reducing this system of
              classification to its essential elements and presenting it in a
              very logical and ordered way, making it readily comprehensible to
              the reader.
            </p>

            <p>
              The book also indicates when the WHO classification corresponds to
              the French-American-British (FAB) classification. All relevant
              cytogenetics and immunophenotypes commonly used to form a
              diagnosis are included.
            </p>

            <h3>Illustrations & Presentation</h3>
            <p>
              The photomicrographs are of a very high standard, representing
              what you would expect to see under the microscope for a given
              disease or disorder. The quality of printing on good paper ensures
              that subtle nuclear and cytoplasmic details are clearly visible.
            </p>

            <p>
              The entire book features clear, concise text written in
              easy-to-read plain English. It presents relevant information with
              very few wasted words. The illustrations have been carefully
              selected to complement the text, and the index is cross-referenced
              to help readers quickly find information.
            </p>

            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>
              It is difficult to find fault with this book. Perhaps future
              editions could include references, as it is not only a practical
              guide for the laboratory but also a valuable teaching text in
              tertiary institutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Final Verdict:</strong> This book is a worthwhile purchase
              for anyone with an interest in morphology or who needs a quick
              reference for haematological conditions.
